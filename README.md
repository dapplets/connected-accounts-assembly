# Connected Accounts Smart Contract

A [smart contract] written in [AssemblyScript] for an app initialized with [create-near-app]

## Quick Start

Before you compile this code, you will need to install [Node.js] â‰¥ 12

## Exploring The Code

1. The main smart contract code lives in `assembly/index.ts`. You can compile
   it with the `./compile` script.
2. Tests: You can run smart contract tests with the `./test` script. This runs
   standard AssemblyScript tests using [as-pect].

## Run the test

To run the test you need to run the NEAR Sandbox locally.

Steps:

1. Install NEAR Sandbox

```
npm i -g near-sandbox
```

2. Go to the directory

```
cd ~/nearcore
```

2. Run the node

```
target/debug/neard-sandbox --home /tmp/near-sandbox init
target/debug/neard-sandbox --home /tmp/near-sandbox run
